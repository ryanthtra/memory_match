Code version of the demo is <a href="https://github.com/ryanthtra/memory_match/tree/gh-pages">here.</a>

### Skills learned from the MVP:
>
- Program and logic flow in JavaScript.
- Variables, functions, and if statements.
- Event-handling (e.g., when a card is clicked, when the page is loaded, etc.)
- Hiding elements until they are needed to be shown.

### Features added to the project since the MVP include:
- Randomly arranged cards.
- Completely re-factored JavaScript code to an object-oriented design.
- Object-oriented state machine controlling the game flow.
- Settings window for changing the number of cards in the game.
- Graphical effects, such as screen-shaking and 3D rotations.
